An OS Development Tutorial.

I could barely find any information in regards to OS Development. So to help future learners, I decided
to write a tutorial. 

## Sources
* [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) by [cfenollosa](https://github.com/cfenollosa)
* The OS Dev [wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
* A countless number of Youtube tutorials

## Prerequisites
* Linux/OS X (use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you are on Windows)
* An internet connection (which I assume you have)
* Some C knowledge (this is an OS development tutorial, not a C crash course)

## How to Use
* The lessons are in folders in this repository in the format ```lesson-no-topic```
* Start at lesson 0 and go in ascending order
* Read the README.md files.
* Make sure to go through each lesson as there might be topics which are covered in the previous topics.
